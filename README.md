# To-Do-List

## About the project
A to-do-list website made using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I created this when I was beginning with front-end development, with the objective of understanding and practicing the basics. But, you can only add tasks.

## Used technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- Java Script

## Initialization

```
git clone https://github.com/GustavoHenriqueSchmitz/To-Do-List.git
```

**2.** To start it, just run the index.html file. If you're using vscode, you can use the `Live Server` extension.
